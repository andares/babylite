> Package path: `packages/babylon-lite/src/flow-graph/`
>
> Status: **IMPLEMENTED / CURRENT COMPATIBILITY BASELINE COMPLETE**. This document is
> the formal specification for Babylon Lite's `FlowGraph` runtime, stable glTF
> `KHR_interactivity` support, and Babylon.js Flow Graph Editor JSON compatibility.

* * *

## Purpose

The flow graph is Babylon's **visual scripting / behaviour runtime**: a directed
graph of nodes ("blocks") that react to engine events and drive scene behaviour
(animate properties, play sounds, branch on conditions, do math). Its primary
real-world consumer is the glTF **`KHR_interactivity`** extension, which embeds
an interactivity graph inside a `.glb` and expects the engine to execute it at
runtime.

**Goal of this port:** load and run interactive glTF assets and execute JSON
saved by the Babylon.js Flow Graph Editor. The two formats are separate parser
front-ends over the same pure-state runtime:

1. a minimal **pure-state runtime** (graph + context + connection model),
2. the **blocks** that `KHR_interactivity` maps to,
3. the **`loader-gltf` extension** that parses the interactivity JSON into a
Lite graph and resolves JSON pointers to scene accessors, and
4. an **editor-JSON adapter** that translates Babylon.js serialized block
graphs into the same Lite graph representation.

Debugger parity and editor-only blocks outside Lite's supported block registry
remain later work. Loading the editor's coordinator and legacy single-graph JSON
formats is in scope; unsupported editor-only block classes fail with a precise
diagnostic rather than being silently discarded.

> **Spec stability caveat (read before touching `flow-graph/gltf/`):**`KHR_interactivity` reached Khronos release-candidate status and was submitted
> for ratification in July 2026, but the checked sources do not yet establish
> final ratification. Babylon.js has replaced the implementation that this port
> originally mirrored. This port therefore continues to isolate all
> spec-dependent code in `flow-graph/gltf/` and records exact reference commits
> so future revisions remain localized.

## Architectural Decision: Pure-State, Not Classes

Babylon.js `FlowGraph` is a deep OOP hierarchy
(`FlowGraphBlock` → `FlowGraphExecutionBlock` → `FlowGraphAsyncExecutionBlock` →
`FlowGraphEventBlock`), with methods on every node, a **global class registry**
(`RegisterClass`) used for deserialization, and module-level `new RichType(...)`
allocations. None of that is permitted in Lite (GUIDANCE §4b′ pure-state
interfaces, §4 zero module-level side effects, 100% tree-shakable).

**Lite re-architects the same semantics as data + functions:**

| Concern | Babylon.js (OOP) | Babylon Lite (pure-state) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Concern<br>A node | Babylon.js (OOP)<br>`class FooBlock extends FlowGraphBlock` with methods | Babylon Lite (pure-state)<br>`FgBlock` **plain data** \+ a `FgBlockDef` record of **pure functions** |
| Concern<br>Node behaviour | Babylon.js (OOP)<br>`block._execute(ctx)` method | Babylon Lite (pure-state)<br>`def.execute(block, ctx, env, signal)` standalone fn |
| Concern<br>Data output calc | Babylon.js (OOP)<br>`block._updateOutputs(ctx)` method | Babylon Lite (pure-state)<br>`def.updateOutputs(block, ctx, env)` standalone fn |
| Concern<br>Type info | Babylon.js (OOP)<br>`class RichType` instances at module scope | Babylon Lite (pure-state)<br>`const enum FgType` string tags + pure `defaultForType()` |
| Concern<br>className → ctor | Babylon.js (OOP)<br>global `RegisterClass` registry (side-effect) | Babylon Lite (pure-state)<br>tree-shakable `getBlockDef(type)` dynamic-import switch |
| Concern<br>Per-run state | Babylon.js (OOP)<br>fields on `FlowGraphContext` instance | Babylon Lite (pure-state)<br>`FgContext` **plain data** mutated by standalone fns |
| Concern<br>Scene access | Babylon.js (OOP)<br>block holds/queries `Scene` | Babylon Lite (pure-state)<br>block touches **only accessors/handles** wired by the loader; the scene **owns and drives** the graph |

The key insight that makes this clean: **BJS already keeps per-instance state in**
**`FlowGraphContext` keyed by block `uniqueId`, not on the block.** The block is
nearly a stateless definition already. Lite finishes the job — the block becomes
_pure data describing topology_, and all behaviour moves into a registry of pure
functions. This also means **porting one block = writing one small data record +**
**one or two pure functions**, which keeps future block ports mechanical (see the
companion skill `port-flow-graph-block.md`).

This mirrors two existing Lite patterns:

- **`loader-gltf/gltf-feature-registry.ts`** — `[trigger, () => import(...)]`
tuples, dynamic-imported only when needed. The block registry uses the same
idea.
- **BJS's own `blockFactory`** — already a tree-shakable `switch` of dynamic
imports (no global side effect). We keep that shape; we only drop the class
bodies behind it.

* * *

## One-Way Ownership & Scene Drive Model (Critical)

GUIDANCE §4b forbids components from referencing the scene. A flow graph
obviously needs to read/write node transforms, fire on scene events, and play
animations — so the wiring is inverted exactly like the animation subsystem:

- The **scene owns** the graphs via an **optional**`scene._flowGraphs?: FgRuntime[]` field (plain data). It is left `undefined` for non-interactivity
scenes and **lazily created by `attachFlowGraph()`** — so core stays
byte-identical when no graph is attached (verified: the per-scene bundle
manifest is unchanged by this subsystem's existence).
- The graph is **driven** through the scene's existing generic seams, NOT a
hardcoded loop in `scene-core.ts` (GUIDANCE §4c′): `attachFlowGraph()` registers
a `onBeforeRender(scene, cb)` driver (exactly how animation groups are ticked)
and an `onSceneDispose(scene, cb)` teardown. The flow-graph drive therefore
lives entirely in `flow-graph/scene-flow-graph.ts`, pulled into a bundle only
when something imports it (the glTF interactivity feature or user code).
- Blocks **never see the scene**. Anything scene-dependent is pre-resolved by the
**loader** into plain capability objects stored in `FgEnv`:

  - **Object accessors** (`FgAccessor { get, set?, target }`) — closures over the
    already-loaded Lite scene objects, produced when a glTF JSON pointer is
    resolved. A `pointer/get` block just calls `accessor.get()`.
  - **Animation handles** — references to the `AnimationGroup` plain-data objects
    the glTF loader already created.
  - **Event sources** — an `FgEventBus` the scene driver feeds (tick, start,
    pointer, key). Event blocks subscribe to the bus, not to the scene.

This keeps the dependency arrow pointing **scene → flow-graph**, never the
reverse, preserving zero circular deps and tree-shakability.

## Public API Surface

All exported from `packages/babylon-lite/src/flow-graph/index.ts` and re-exported
from the package `index.ts`. Everything is plain data + standalone functions.

```typescript
/** Per-execution-instance MUTABLE state — plain data. */

    _tokenSeq: number;
}

/** One outstanding async task (a delay, an animation). Token enables precise cancel. */
export interface FgPendingTask {

    /** scene-owned capabilities blocks may invoke WITHOUT a scene reference:
     *  play/stop animation, create a temp interpolation group, subscribe to
     *  animation-end, etc. Provided by the loader/animation subsystem. */

### Standalone runtime functions (`flow-graph/runtime.ts`)

```typescript

/** Instantiate runtime state for a parsed graph. */
export function createFgContext(graph: FgGraph, opts?: { rightHanded?: boolean }): FgContext;
/** Build the resolved env (await needed defs, attach accessors/animations/bus).
 *  Editor-authored unknown block types fail loudly. KHR unsupported operations
 *  are translated to registered typed no-op blocks before this boundary. */
export function createFgEnv(graph: FgGraph, wiring?: FgWiring): Promise<FgEnv>;

/** One graph runtime = graph + context + env, owned by the scene. */
export interface FgRuntime {
    readonly graph: FgGraph;
    readonly context: FgContext;
    readonly env: FgEnv;
    started: boolean;
    /** @internal bus unsubscribe fns registered at start, called on dispose */
    _unsub: (() => void)[];
}

/** Convenience: build env (awaiting defs) + context in one call. */
export function createFgRuntime(graph: FgGraph, wiring?: FgWiring, opts?: { rightHanded?: boolean }): Promise<FgRuntime>;

/** Start the graph: subscribe ALL non-start receivers first (init-priority

export function startFlowGraph(rt: FgRuntime): void;
/** Per-frame drive: pump tick events + advance pending async blocks. */
export function tickFlowGraph(rt: FgRuntime, deltaMs: number): void;
/** Tear down: cancel pending, clear caches, detach bus listeners. */
export function disposeFlowGraph(rt: FgRuntime): void;

// Pending-task helpers used by async block defs and the tick loop:
export function addPending(ctx: FgContext, block: FgBlock, state?: Record<string, unknown>): FgPendingTask;
export function stillPending(ctx: FgContext, task: FgPendingTask): boolean;
export function cancelPendingForBlock(ctx: FgContext, block: FgBlock): void;
export function compactPending(ctx: FgContext): void;
```

### Scene attachment (`flow-graph/scene-flow-graph.ts`)

```typescript
/** Attach a runtime to a scene: starts on the first frame, ticks every frame,
 *  auto-disposed on scene dispose. Lazily creates `scene._flowGraphs`. Uses the
 *  generic onBeforeRender/onSceneDispose seams (no scene-core loop). */
export function attachFlowGraph(scene: SceneContext, rt: FgRuntime): void;
/** Detach + dispose a previously attached runtime. */
export function detachFlowGraph(scene: SceneContext, rt: FgRuntime): void;
```

### Block-type names & registry (`flow-graph/block-type.ts`, `block-registry.ts`)

```typescript
/** Lite block type identifiers (const enum string tags). */
export const enum FgBlockType {
    // Events
    SceneStart = "SceneReadyEvent",
    SceneTick = "SceneTickEvent",
    SendCustomEvent = "SendCustomEvent",
    ReceiveCustomEvent = "ReceiveCustomEvent",

    ValueInterpolation = "ValueInterpolation",
    PlayAnimation = "PlayAnimation", StopAnimation = "StopAnimation",
    // Debug
    ConsoleLog = "ConsoleLog",
}

/**

export function getBlockDef(type: string): () => Promise<FgBlockDef> {
    switch (type) {
        case FgBlockType.Branch:
            return async () => (await import("./blocks/control-flow/branch.js")).branchDef;

    }
}

## Internal Architecture

### Execution model (pull data, push signals)

Identical semantics to BJS, re-expressed functionally:

- **Data edges are PULL, and recompute on every pull.** When a block needs an
input, `getDataValue` looks at the socket's `source`. If wired, it finds the
producing block and **invokes that block's `def.updateOutputs` every time**
(matching BJS `FlowGraphDataConnection.getValue`, which calls the owner's
`_updateOutputs` on each read). `ctx.connectionValues` is the **transport slot**
the producer writes into and the consumer reads back — **not** a validity
cache. Do **not** skip recomputation based on a cached value: producers like
`pointer/get`, `GetVariable`, `random`, and event-payload outputs would return
stale data after an intervening `pointer/set`/`SetVariable` in the same
cascade. (A future optimization may add explicit dirty-tracking with cascade
IDs, but it must exclude all non-pure producers; the MVP recomputes.)
- **Cycles.** Data pulls assume an acyclic data subgraph (as glTF interactivity
requires). `getDataValue` carries an in-progress guard
(`ctx.executionVariables["${id}:resolving"]`) to break accidental data cycles
and return the socket default rather than recursing infinitely.
- **Type coercion on read.**`getDataValue` applies (a) any socket/port
`dataTransformer` declared by the declaration mapper, then (b) `coerceValue`
for the consumer socket's `FgType` — this is where BJS's RichType
`typeTransformer` lives (notably `Vector4`/`Matrix` → `Quaternion`). Coercion
happens at the boundary so block bodies stay type-clean.
- **Signal edges are PUSH.**`activateSignal` iterates `signalSocket.targets`;
for each, it looks up the target block's def and calls `def.execute`, passing
the incoming signal name. Execution blocks call `activateSignal` on their own
outputs to continue the cascade.
- **Event blocks** declare `event: FgEventType`. The scene driver, on receiving a
bus event, finds matching event blocks and fires their output signals
(`out` / `done`), starting a cascade. **Listener registration ordering is**
**significant:**`startFlowGraph` first subscribes/initializes _all_ event
receivers (in init-priority order — `ReceiveCustomEvent` before scene-start-like
events, matching BJS `initPriority`), and _only then_ fires the `onStart`
cascade. Otherwise a graph like `onStart → SendCustomEvent → ReceiveCustomEvent`
would drop the event because the receiver wasn't listening yet. Custom events
are **scene/coordinator-scoped**, not per-graph, so multiple `KHR_interactivity`
graphs in one asset can communicate.
- **Async blocks** (`SetDelay`, `PlayAnimation`) register an `FgPendingTask` via
`addPending(ctx, block)` (which assigns a unique token and **dedupes** so a
block re-entered while already pending does not double-tick), get `onTick`'d
each frame, and fire a completion signal (`done`) when finished, then remove
the task. A single block may own **multiple concurrent tasks** (BJS supports
several in-flight delays per block, tracked by index) — state lives on the
task record, not the block. `cancelPending` marks the matching task(s)
`canceled`; the tick loop skips canceled/removed tasks (see below).

### Async task lifecycle (ordering hazards)

The per-frame pending loop must be cancellation-safe. A task can be canceled or a
new task added **during** the loop by another block's signal cascade. Rules:

```javascript
for task of ctx.pending.slice():          // snapshot
  if task.canceled: continue              // skip if canceled this frame
  if !stillPending(ctx, task): continue   // skip if already removed
  env.defs[blockOf(task)].onTick(task, …) // may add/cancel further tasks
ctx.pending = ctx.pending.filter(t => !t.canceled && !t.done)  // compact after
```

Tasks added mid-loop are picked up next frame (not retro-ticked), matching BJS.
Each `FgContext` has its own `pending` list, so multiple contexts (multi-actor)
never interfere.

### Per-frame flow

```javascript
scene._beforeRender(deltaMs)               // existing Lite hook
  └─ for rt of scene._flowGraphs:
       if !rt.started:
         registerEventListeners(rt)         // subscribe ALL receivers first (init-priority order)
         startFlowGraph(rt)                  // THEN fire onStart event blocks once
       tickFlowGraph(rt, deltaMs):
         resetCustomEventRecursionCounters(rt.context)   // guard against runaway re-entrancy
         env.events.pump("tick", { deltaTime: deltaMs/1000 })  // → onTick blocks
         for task of ctx.pending.slice():   // cancellation-safe (see async lifecycle)
           if task.canceled || !stillPending(ctx, task): continue
           env.defs[blockOf(task)].onTick?.(task, ctx, env, deltaMs)
         compactPending(ctx.context)
```

Pointer/key events are fed into `env.events` by the picking/input layer; event
blocks simply subscribe to the corresponding bus channel. Pointer selection is
an explicit capability: call `enableFlowGraphPointerPicking(scene)` when a scene
uses pointer-event blocks. This keeps the GPU picker out of non-interactive glTF
bundles. Pick dispatch and selectability are scoped to the glTF asset that owns
the picked mesh, so assets may safely reuse the same node indices in one scene.

### Custom math & types live IN the subsystem (bundle discipline)

Lite's core `math/` module is intentionally minimal (Vec3-centric; **no Vec2,**
**no general quaternion/matrix algebra**). Flow-graph math blocks need Vec2,
quaternion mul/conjugate/slerp, matrix transpose/determinant/inverse/compose/
decompose, integer bitwise ops, etc. Per GUIDANCE §4c′ (always extensions, never
bloat the core) these helpers live **inside `flow-graph/`** (e.g.
`flow-graph/fg-math.ts`, `flow-graph/custom-types/`), lazily imported by the
blocks that use them. Scenes without interactivity pay **zero bytes**. Core
`math/` is reused where it already suffices (`addVec3`, `dotVec3`, `crossVec3`,
`mat4Multiply`, `mat4Invert`, `mat4Compose`, `mat4Decompose`, `mat4FromQuat`).

### Custom types (`flow-graph/custom-types/`)

- `FgInteger` — glTF distinguishes `int` from `float`; represented as a tagged
plain object `{ value: number; __fgInt: true }` (no class) so type coercion and
bitwise ops work. Pure helpers `fgInt(n)`, `isFgInt(v)`.
- `FgMatrix2D` / `FgMatrix3D` — plain `Float32Array`-backed (`{ m: Float32Array }`)
for `float2x2` / `float3x3` glTF types, with pure op helpers.
- `Vec2` — add to `flow-graph/types.ts` (or a tiny local) since core math lacks it.

### Rich-type behaviour without RichType instances (`flow-graph/rich-type.ts`)

BJS's `RichType` carries three things Lite must preserve even though it drops the
class: a **default value**, a **typeTransformer**, and an **animationType**.

- `defaultForType(t: FgType): FgValue` — pure switch returning the type's default
(e.g. `0`, `false`, fresh `Vec3.zero`, identity quaternion). Replaces
`RichType.defaultValue`. Constructs values **inside the function** (no
module-level allocation).
- `coerceValue(value, target: FgType): FgValue` — the home of BJS's
`typeTransformer`. Critically includes **`Vector4`/`Matrix` → `Quaternion`** and
numeric↔integer coercions. Invoked by `getDataValue` on read (step (b) above),
and by the mapper when a config/socket declares a `flowGraphType` different from
its `gltfType`.
- `animationTypeForFgType(t: FgType): number` — replaces `RichType.animationType`,
used by `ValueInterpolation`/animation blocks to pick the correct keyframe
interpolation (float/vector/quaternion/color/matrix). Quaternion targets must
resolve to slerp; the mapper's `useSlerp` flag forces `FgType.Quaternion`.

These three pure functions are the complete replacement for the `RichType` class
and its module-scope instances.

## glTF `KHR_interactivity` Loader Extension

> Package path: `packages/babylon-lite/src/loader-gltf/gltf-feature-interactivity.ts`
> plus `flow-graph/gltf/` for the parser + declaration mapper.

### Release-candidate spec — keep the translation layer isolated

The port originally targeted Babylon.js commit `8f728b23ea` while
**[PR #18455](https://github.com/BabylonJS/Babylon.js/pull/18455)** was still
open. That target is obsolete. The compatibility refresh targets:

- Khronos glTF repository commit `fdb8ce0e2e0b7ecf3466f8dacb9f1385257b8276`.
- Babylon.js commit `bd3837eed0890e590fdd6aeb6cc4d605e4eb8ac7`.

The release candidate was submitted for ratification in July 2026; final
ratification was not confirmed when these commits were recorded. The op set,
object model, and validation rules can therefore still evolve.

**Design rule (mandatory):** the spec-volatile surface must be **quarantined in**
**`flow-graph/gltf/`** and depend on the runtime, never the reverse. The runtime
core (`runtime.ts`, `block-def.ts`, `context.ts`, blocks) must contain **zero**
glTF/`KHR_interactivity` knowledge, so a spec revision never touches the engine —
only the `gltf/` translation layer:

- `interactivity-parser.ts` — JSON shape of nodes/declarations/variables/flows.
- `declaration-mapper.ts` — the op→block table (the part most likely to churn).
- `path-converter.ts` \+ `object-model-mapping.ts` — JSON-pointer semantics.
- a recorded Khronos/Babylon.js reference commit in the mapper header and tests.

**Practical guardrails so future spec changes are cheap:**

- Keep the op→block mapping a **plain-data table**, not code, so edits are diffs
to data (and so a future "import the BJS table" step stays mechanical).
- Re-diff `declaration-mapper.ts` against the recorded Babylon.js commit when
updating either reference. Keep an operation-coverage test that compares all
known native operations with registered mappings.
- Do not invent an asset-level version switch: the release-candidate extension
has no such discriminator. If a future revision adds one, branch at this
translation boundary.
- Unknown operations produce structured diagnostics and typed no-op blocks.
Structural/schema violations reject only the affected graph.
- The companion skill (`port-flow-graph-block.md`) is the routine for absorbing
new/changed ops as the spec and the BJS PR evolve.

### Registration (no side effects, lazy)

Add one tuple to `gltf-feature-registry.ts`, identical to every other feature:

```typescript
["KHR_interactivity", () => import("./gltf-feature-interactivity.js")],
```

The feature implements `GltfFeature.applyAsset(meshes, root, ctx)`:

1. Read `ctx._json.extensions.KHR_interactivity`. `graphs` is required; optional
`graph` selects the default graph.
2. For each graph, run the **interactivity parser** → `FgGraph` (plain data).
Catch parse/validation errors per graph so one invalid graph cannot invalidate
the asset.
3. **Resolve JSON pointers** in the graph to `FgAccessor`s over the already-built
Lite scene objects (nodes/meshes/cameras/materials/animations) via a path
converter (Lite analogue of BJS `gltfPathToObjectConverter` +
`objectModelMapping`).
4. Build `FgEnv` (await needed block defs, attach accessors/animations/event bus).
5. Return the successfully parsed graphs in the `AssetContainer` and contribute
a deferred `_sceneSetup` hook. `addToScene` resolves runtimes with the target
scene's shared event bus, pushes them onto `scene._flowGraphs`, and registers
paired cleanup. Callers do not need to invoke `runFlowGraphs` manually.

> The loader sets the equivalent of BJS's `_skipStartAnimationStep` — animations
> referenced by interactivity must **not** auto-play; the graph controls them.

### Interactivity parser (`flow-graph/gltf/interactivity-parser.ts`)

Pure translation of each glTF interactivity graph
(`types`, `declarations`, `variables`, `events`, and `nodes`) into an
`FgGraph`. Stages mirror BJS `InteractivityGraphToFlowGraphParser`:
`parseTypes → parseDeclarations → parseVariables → parseEvents → parseNodes → parseConnections`. Output is plain data — **no block instances, no class registry**.

glTF→Lite type table (from BJS, kept verbatim):

| glTF type | length | FgType | element |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| glTF type<br>`float` | length<br>1 | FgType<br>Number | element<br>number |
| glTF type<br>`bool` | length<br>1 | FgType<br>Boolean | element<br>boolean |
| glTF type<br>`int` | length<br>1 | FgType<br>Integer | element<br>number |
| glTF type<br>`float2` | length<br>2 | FgType<br>Vector2 | element<br>number |
| glTF type<br>`float3` | length<br>3 | FgType<br>Vector3 | element<br>number |
| glTF type<br>`float4` | length<br>4 | FgType<br>Vector4 | element<br>number |
| glTF type<br>`float2x2` | length<br>4 | FgType<br>Matrix2D | element<br>number |
| glTF type<br>`float3x3` | length<br>9 | FgType<br>Matrix3D | element<br>number |
| glTF type<br>`float4x4` | length<br>16 | FgType<br>Matrix | element<br>number |
| glTF type<br>`ref` | length<br>1 | FgType<br>Reference | element<br>JSON Pointer string (`""` = null) |

Release-candidate parser semantics:

- Type/default validation follows the Khronos schemas. Numeric, vector, and
matrix defaults preserve the spec's NaN defaults where specified.
- `events` declares custom-event ids and typed payload fields. Send/receive
blocks use those declarations for socket types and defaults.
- Event receivers expose an opaque event reference. `event/stopPropagation`
consumes it and prevents later receivers in the same dispatch from running.
- glTF custom-event delivery is asynchronous by default. The coordinator's
editor-JSON `dispatchEventsSynchronously` option remains independently
configurable.
- A connected animation-time input is converted from seconds to frames at
runtime; constants may be pre-transformed.
- Pointer templates validate all placeholders and support dynamic segments.
Virtual/object-model pointers include the release-candidate active-camera,
capability/limit, event-reference, delay, and animation-state surfaces.

### Declaration mapper (`flow-graph/gltf/declaration-mapper.ts`)

The largest single artefact (current BJS = **135 native ops**). It is a **data**
**table** mapping each glTF op (`"math/add"`, `"flow/branch"`, `"pointer/set"`, …)
to: target Lite block type(s), socket renames, config translation, value
transformers (e.g. seconds→frames for animation time), and multi-block expansions
(e.g. `pointer/set` → `SetProperty` \+ `JsonPointerParser` linked by an
inter-block connector). This is plain data + small pure transformer functions —
no classes. Porting entries is the bulk of ongoing work and is exactly what the
companion **skill** automates.

```typescript
export interface FgDeclMapping {
    blocks: FgBlockType[];
    inputs?: { values?: Record<string, FgPortMap>; flows?: Record<string, FgPortMap> };
    outputs?: { values?: Record<string, FgPortMap>; flows?: Record<string, FgPortMap> };
    configuration?: Record<string, FgPortMap>;
    interBlockConnectors?: { input: string; output: string; inBlock: number; outBlock: number }[];
    extraProcessor?: (gltfBlock: unknown, /* … */) => FgBlock[];
}
export function getMappingForOp(op: string, extension?: string): FgDeclMapping | undefined;
```

* * *

## Block coverage (`KHR_interactivity`)

`KHR_interactivity` maps 135 native operations onto fewer Lite block types via
configuration. The refresh adds the ten operations absent from the original
126-operation target: `event/stopPropagation`, `math/Tau`,
`math/smoothStep`, `math/rgbToOkLCh`, `math/rgbFromOkLCh`,
`math/quatSlerp`, `math/slerp`, `ref/eq`, `math/quatFromUpForward`, and
`math/quatFromAngles`.

- **Events (4):**`onStart`→SceneStart, `onTick`→SceneTick, `event/send`→SendCustomEvent, `event/receive`→ReceiveCustomEvent.
- **Flow control (11):** branch, sequence, switch, while, for, doN, multiGate, waitAll, throttle, setDelay, cancelDelay.
- **Math constants/arithmetic/comparison/trig/exp (~60 ops → ~40 blocks):** E, Pi, Inf, NaN, random; abs/sign/trunc/floor/ceil/round/fract/neg; add/sub/mul/div/rem/min/max/clamp/saturate/mix; eq/lt/le/gt/ge/select; sin…atanh; exp/log/log2/log10/sqrt/cbrt/pow; isNaN/isInf; rad/deg.
- **Vector/matrix/quaternion (~25 ops):** length, normalize, dot, cross, rotate2D/3D, transform, transpose, determinant, inverse, matMul, matCompose/Decompose, combineN/extractN, quat ops.
- **Integer bitwise (9):** not/and/or/xor/asr/lsl/clz/ctz/popcnt.
- **Type conversion (6):** bool/int/float cross conversions.
- **Variables (3):** get, set, interpolate.
- **Pointers (3):** get, set, interpolate (+ JsonPointerParser).
- **Animation (3):** start, stop, stopAt (+ ArrayIndex / data provider).
- `flow/log` is a Babylon extension operation rather than a native KHR
operation. `event/onSelect` remains extension-namespaced through
`KHR_node_selectability`.

Each block is one small file under `flow-graph/blocks/<category>/<name>.ts`
exporting a `FgBlockDef`. See the skill doc for the exact file template.

## Dependencies

- **Core math** (`src/math/`): reuse `addVec3`, `dotVec3`, `crossVec3`,
`mat4Multiply`, `mat4Invert`, `mat4Compose`, `mat4Decompose`, `mat4FromQuat`.
- **Animation** (`src/animation/`): `AnimationGroup` handles for animation blocks;
`ValueInterpolation` reuses the interpolation/easing machinery where possible.
- **Scene** (`src/scene/`): `onBeforeRender`, `onSceneDispose`, `addToScene`
dispatch, the `_flowGraphs` array (new field).
- **Loader-gltf** (`src/loader-gltf/`): `GltfFeature` hook + registry tuple; the
node/material/camera maps the path-converter resolves against.
- **Picking/input**: pointer & key events forwarded into `FgEventBus`; the GPU
pointer bridge is enabled explicitly with `enableFlowGraphPointerPicking`.
- **New, subsystem-local:**`flow-graph/fg-math.ts`, `flow-graph/custom-types/`.

* * *

## Test Specification

- **Unit (vitest):** per-block defs — feed inputs, assert outputs/signals
(pure functions, trivial to test). Runtime: **pull recompute** (verify a
producer re-runs on every read, no stale cache), push cascade, async delay
countdown with **cancellation mid-tick** and **multiple concurrent delays per**
**block**, event dispatch with **listener-before-onStart ordering** (custom event
fired from `onStart` is received).
- **Math parity tests (focused):** quaternion mul/conjugate/slerp,
matrix compose/decompose/transpose/inverse, `math/transform`, and the
**accessor-boundary handedness** (right-handed glTF value → Lite LH) — these are
the easiest places to diverge on multiplication order / row-vs-column layout.
- **Coercion tests:**`Vector4`/`Matrix` → `Quaternion` via `coerceValue`;
`animationTypeForFgType` picks slerp for quaternion targets.
- **Parser unit tests:** representative interactivity JSON → expected `FgGraph`
topology; declaration-mapper entries → expected blocks/sockets/config;
unsupported op → typed no-op + diagnostic; malformed graph → only that graph
rejected.
- **Editor JSON tests:** coordinator and legacy single-graph fixtures saved by
the current Babylon.js Flow Graph Editor; rich-value/default/context restore;
connection reconstruction by connection-point id; execute the parsed graph;
unknown editor block → precise diagnostic.
- **Integration / parity:** a `KHR_interactivity` sample `.glb` (e.g. a
Khronos sample like a button that animates on click, or `onStart`→rotate)
loaded in Lite; assert the driven property changes over frames. Where a visual
golden is warranted, follow §2c animated-scene golden convention
(`?seekTime=` freeze). Add a `scene-config.json` entry + bundle-size ceiling
only when a parity scene is added.
- **Bundle-size guard:** verify a non-interactivity scene's bundle is
**byte-unchanged** (the subsystem must be fully tree-shaken away when unused).

## Phased Implementation Plan

> Each phase is independently mergeable; engine-changing phases must pass
> `pnpm build:bundle-scenes` \+ `pnpm test:parity` and commit the regenerated
> `lab/public/bundle/manifest.json` (GUIDANCE §0c).

**Phase 0 — Spec & skill (this doc + `port-flow-graph-block.md`).** ✅ DONE — no code.

**Phase 1 — Core runtime, no blocks.** ✅ **DONE.**`types.ts`, `block-def.ts`,
`context.ts`, `runtime.ts`, `event-bus.ts`, `rich-type.ts`, `block-type.ts`,
`custom-types/{fg-integer,fg-matrix}.ts`, `scene-flow-graph.ts`, and an empty
`block-registry.ts`. Pure functions only. 24 unit tests cover pull recompute,
push cascade, branch routing, async pending (countdown, dedupe, cancel
mid-tick, no retro-tick), event dispatch + custom-event-during-start ordering,
tick pump, dispose, variable seeding, loud-fail on unknown ops, and rich-type
defaults/coercion. Scene drive wired via the `onBeforeRender`/`onSceneDispose`
seams. **Guard met:** non-interactivity bundle manifest byte-identical.

**Phase 2 — Vertical slice (end-to-end EARLY).** Implement the _minimum_ set that
proves the whole pipeline before the long tail of blocks: `SceneStart`,
`SceneTick`, `Branch`, `Sequence`, one math op (`Add`), `GetProperty`/`SetProperty`

- `JsonPointerParser`, `PlayAnimation`/`StopAnimation`; plus a **minimal**
parser + declaration-mapper (just those ops) + path-converter + the
`gltf-feature-interactivity.ts` loader hook; plus **one** Khronos
`KHR_interactivity` sample running end-to-end as a parity scene. This surfaces
mapper/accessor/runtime/handedness mismatches immediately rather than after the
whole block library is written.

**Phase 3 — Broaden block library.** Fill in the rest of the ~60 blocks
(full math/trig/exp, vector/matrix/quaternion, integer bitwise, type conversion,
variables, interpolation, control-flow remainder) + `fg-math.ts` +
`custom-types/**`; register each in `block-registry.ts`. Unit-test each def.

**Phase 4 — Complete the original declaration mapper.** ✅ DONE for the old
126-operation target. Additional parity scenes remain optional coverage work.

**Phase 5a — Imperative builder and scene coordinator.** ✅ DONE. Builder creates the
same `FgGraph` plain data as parser front-ends. The coordinator owns multiple
graphs, one scene event bus, and synchronous/asynchronous custom-event policy.

**Phase 5b — Release-candidate KHR refresh.** ✅ DONE for the current Lite host
surface. Rebase parser/mapper behavior on
the recorded Khronos and Babylon.js commits. Add the ten operation gaps, `ref`,
declared events/payloads, event references and propagation, typed no-ops,
per-graph isolation, asynchronous event dispatch, dynamic pointer segments,
expanded object-model pointers, and runtime animation-time conversion.

**Phase 5c — Babylon.js Flow Graph Editor JSON.** ✅ DONE for serialized block
classes ported to Lite. Add a second parser front-end
alongside `gltf/interactivity-parser.ts`. Supported input forms:

```typescript
// Coordinator form
{ _flowGraphs: SerializedFlowGraph[], activeGraphIndex,
  dispatchEventsSynchronously, sceneSnippetId?, flowGraphSnippetId? }

// Legacy form
{ allBlocks: SerializedBlock[], executionContexts: SerializedContext[],
  name?, uniqueId?, rightHanded?, editorData? }
```

`SerializedBlock` contains `className`, `type`, `config`, `uniqueId`,
data/signal inputs and outputs, and metadata. Connections are reconstructed from
connection-point `uniqueId`/`connectedPointIds`. Values may come from a
connection's `defaultValue` or a context's `_connectionValues`; rich values use
`{ value, className }`. The adapter maps Babylon block class names to Lite
`FgBlockType`, restores user variables, and returns one graph/context record per
serialized execution context. It also recognizes serialized JSON embedded in
the Babylon-specific `BABYLON_flow_graph` glTF extension. Unsupported
editor-only blocks fail clearly; they are not typed no-ops.

**Phase 6+ — Editor-only block parity and debugger hooks.** Port blocks as
needed using the companion skill. Current editor-only gaps include input,
interpolation-animation construction, debounce/flip-flop, coordinate
transforms, easing/context/array/code, physics, and audio blocks.

## Open Questions / Risks

- **Release-candidate churn.** Final ratification was not confirmed at the
recorded reference commits. Mitigation remains structural: all
spec-dependent code is quarantined in `flow-graph/gltf/` and mirrored against
exact Khronos/Babylon.js commits; the runtime core remains spec-agnostic.
- **Editor format churn.** Editor JSON is a Babylon.js serialization contract,
not the Khronos format. Keep it isolated in `flow-graph/editor-serialization.ts`, test
current official fixtures, and fail loudly when a serialized class is unknown.
- **Host object-model breadth.** Pointer support is limited to concepts exposed
by Lite. Add accessors in `path-converter.ts` as Lite gains more glTF host
