## Purpose

Device-lost recovery is an opt-in, engine-wide replacement-device workflow.
Each public enabler registers exactly one rendering-context kind with the shared
internal coordinator. The coordinator reacquires the `GPUDevice`, reconfigures
all surfaces, rebuilds every captured texture, and then dispatches to the
enabled kind handlers. A registered context whose kind has no enabled handler
cannot be recovered, so the coordinator fails the recovery rather than resuming
with it; no context is cast to another kind.

## Public API Surface

```typescript
export interface DeviceLostRecoveryCallbacks {
    onLost?: (info: GPUDeviceLostInfo) => void;
    onRecovered?: () => void;
    onRecoveryFailed?: (error: unknown) => void;
}
export interface DeviceLostRecoveryHandle {
    disable(): void;
}

export function enableDeviceLostSceneRecovery(engine: EngineContext, options?: DeviceLostRecoveryCallbacks): DeviceLostRecoveryHandle;
export function enableDeviceLostSpriteRecovery(engine: EngineContext, options?: DeviceLostRecoveryCallbacks): DeviceLostRecoveryHandle;
export function enableDeviceLostTextRecovery(engine: EngineContext, options?: DeviceLostRecoveryCallbacks): DeviceLostRecoveryHandle;
```

An enabler covers every currently or subsequently registered context of its
kind on every surface owned by `engine`; callers never pass renderer instances.
The generic `_enableDeviceLostRecovery` coordinator remains internal and is not
exported from the package root.

## Coordinator Dispatch

`RenderingContext._kind` is the dispatch key. Public adapters use:

| Enabler | `_kind` | Enumerated contexts |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Enabler<br>Scene | `_kind`<br>`scene` | Enumerated contexts<br>`SceneContext` |
| Enabler<br>Sprite | `_kind`<br>`sprite-renderer` | Enumerated contexts<br>`SpriteRenderer` |
| Enabler<br>Text | `_kind`<br>`text-renderer` | Enumerated contexts<br>`TextRenderer` |

On loss, the coordinator snapshots active registrations and collapses them to
one handler per kind. It stops the engine, verifies that every registered
context's kind has a handler, requests one replacement device with the original
features and storage limits, rebuilds engine storage buffers, reconfigures every
surface, refreshes swapchain render targets, resizes contexts, rebuilds every
captured texture, invokes each registered kind handler, and restarts the engine
only if it had been running. A registered context of a kind with no handler
fails the recovery: leaving it on the lost device would let the application
resume and encode draws against freed native objects, which kills the browser's
renderer process rather than producing a catchable error. The check runs after
the engine stops but before anything is disposed or a replacement device is
requested, so `onRecoveryFailed` fires with the engine intact and the
application can discard it deliberately. Callback order is `onLost` before
replacement, `onRecovered` after rebuild and the first resumed frame, or
`onRecoveryFailed` if any registered recovery step rejects.
Standalone renderer handlers run before Scene rebuilding so a texture or glyph
atlas shared with a scene is current before scene renderables recreate bindings.

Multiple calls for the same kind create independent handles and callbacks.
Kind-level enable work runs on the first registration; kind-level disable work
runs only after the last handle for that kind is disabled. `disable()` is
idempotent. Scene and Sprite registrations share a ref-counted texture/mesh
capture hook, so disabling either kind cannot remove capture while the other
still needs it. Mesh geometry retention is counted separately and is active
only while Scene recovery is enabled; Sprite-only recovery retains textures,
not unrelated mesh arrays.

## Resource Ownership and Rebuild

### Scene

Scene recovery retains mesh CPU geometry, texture recovery sources, and
environment loader sources only while capture is enabled. Its loss-only module
rebuilds textures, geometry, skeletons, morph targets, environment lighting,
shadow generators, renderables, scene/light bind groups, frame-graph tasks, and
render targets.

Environment recovery supports `loadEnvironment` (`.env`) and
`loadHdrEnvironment`. Recovery must be enabled before the environment is
loaded so the URL/settings source is retained. It recreates the specular cube
and BRDF LUT on the replacement device while preserving the public
`EnvironmentTextures` object identity, and installs a single scene disposable
that owns the replacement textures. Loader-owned skybox and ground renderables
are recreated after material groups rebuild, for both loaders: the solid
skybox, the ground plane, the DDS cube skybox, and the HDR skybox that reuses
the lighting cubemap. glTF `EXT_lights_image_based` environments are not yet
recoverable; recovery fails explicitly rather than rendering with stale device
resources.

### Loader capture seam

Loaders never contain recovery semantics. `loadEnvironment` and
`loadHdrEnvironment` each carry exactly one optional-chained `engine._dlr?.e(…)`
/ `engine._dlr?.h(…)` call built from locals the loader already computes. All
meaning — what a recovery source is, which cases are unsupported, and how to
rebuild — lives in `device-lost-recovery-capture.ts` and
`loader-env/environment-recovery.ts`, which are reachable only from
`enableDeviceLostSceneRecovery`. Applications that never enable recovery pull in
none of those chunks.

Backgrounds are discovered, not captured. Each background builder stamps a plain
rebuild thunk onto the `Renderable` it returns — `Renderable._rebuild`, a
`() => Renderable | Promise<Renderable>` closing over the arguments the builder
already received. Recovery snapshots those thunks while traversing
`scene._renderables` and replays them in order, the same way material textures
already recover through `Texture2D._recoverySource`. The always-bundled
`loadEnvironment` / `loadHdr` path therefore carries no per-background recovery
code at all, and the residual cost lands only in `background-*.js`, which a scene
already pays for whenever it builds that background.

The thunk is deliberately opaque. An earlier revision stamped a descriptor tuple
— `[kind, size, rootPosition, url?]` — that recovery interpreted through a
four-arm switch over an `EnvironmentBackgroundKind`. That put a `loader-env`
concept onto `render/`'s lowest-level interface, and the only way to avoid the
import was to write the kind as a magic number at each builder, which hid the
dependency from the compiler rather than removing it. A thunk deletes the enum,
the descriptor type, the switch, and its four `await import()` calls: each
builder is already its own module, so replay needs no dispatch. It is also more
correct — the tuple silently dropped `enableNoise` for the ground and DDS
skybox, which a closure captures for free — and it composes across repeated
losses, because each rebuilt renderable stamps a fresh thunk.

`_rebuild` is only for renderables that no retained structure owns. Mesh-backed
renderables keep recovering through `scene._groups`, and must not also carry a
thunk. That is not inertia: a group build emits several renderables at once (or
merges its meshes into one), and re-running it also restores the group's
`rebuildSingle` closure, its `o` output list, and its uniform updater — none of
which a `Renderable`-returning thunk can express. `scene._groups` is live state
that already regenerates those renderables for material swaps and runtime mesh
adds, so recovery borrows it rather than duplicating it. Setting both mechanisms
on one renderable would rebuild it twice and leave a duplicate in
`scene._renderables`. Backgrounds needed a thunk precisely because they are
orphans — not mesh-backed, pushed straight into `scene._renderables` by a loader
that then discards the locals they were built from.

Two capture-based designs were measured first and rejected. Describing
backgrounds up front — passing the loaders' strategy inputs to one seam and
re-deriving the rules during recovery — cost ~65 B for _every_ environment-loading
scene. Per-background capture (`engine._dlr?.g(...)` inside each builder's `if`
block) narrowed that to ~21 B, but still only for scenes that build a background.
Discovery removes the loader seam entirely. Against the pre-feature baseline the
feature now measures +1,707 B across 73 scenes, of which scene164 — the recovery
parity scene, and the only one that enables recovery — carries +1,554 B; 56
scenes are _smaller_ than before because the loader capture seam is gone. The 11
background-building scenes pay 16–56 B each for the thunk. The thunk is stamped
unconditionally rather than gated on capture being enabled; one closure per
background is cheaper than the branch that would guard it. Choosing thunks over
descriptors also lowered scene164's ceiling requirement by ~1.6 KB, since the
recovery chunk no longer carries the switch or its dynamic imports.

Property names beginning with `_` are mangled in release builds, so `_rebuild`
costs no more than an abbreviated name would; internal fields are spelled out.

Capture arguments must stay primitive. Rollup tracks the property values of
object literals and uses them to prove branches dead. Passing an object whose
properties gate tree-shakeable code — such as `bgOptions`, whose `skipSkybox` /
`skipGround` guard the loader's `await import()` of the background modules —
forces Rollup to deoptimize it, because the unknown callee could mutate it. It
then loses the known property values and retains `background-ground.js`
(+4,968 B) and `background-solid-skybox.js` (+1,882 B) in scenes that had
tree-shaken them. This is why the remaining seams (`_dlr.e` / `_dlr.h`) pass
already-computed scalars.

Shadow generators are recovered in place before material groups are rebuilt.
Recovery deduplicates generators referenced by `scene.lights` and
`scene.shadowGenerators`, disposes their nested render-task state, recreates
their device-owned textures, samplers, uniform buffers, pipelines, and bind
groups, and preserves the public `ShadowGenerator` identity. This currently
supports directional ESM generators, the shadow type used by Babylon Lite
Viewer; recovery fails explicitly for PCF or CSM instead of resuming with stale
device resources. ESM retains only the two blur scalars it cannot reconstruct —
`_blurKernel` and `_blurScale`, held as internal fields on the generator's
`EsmShadowTaskResources` — and `shadow-recovery.ts` reads them from that object
during the loss-only rebuild. `_blurScale` is retained rather than re-derived as
`mapSize / _blurTexH.width` because `blurSize` is not integral for every scale,
so the round trip through a texture dimension cannot recover the caller's
original value. Every remaining option is derived from steady-state runtime
fields: `mapSize`, `bias`, `orthoMinZ`, `orthoMaxZ`, and `forceRefreshEveryFrame`
from the generator's `_config`, and `darkness`, `depthScale`, and
`frustumEdgeFalloff` from its `_shadowsInfo` array.
Rebuilding material groups afterward binds receivers and casters only to
replacement-device resources.

The shared 1x1 PBR fallback texture is cleared once per recovery, before any
scene is rebuilt, because it is engine-scoped and the PBR fallback resolver
recreates it lazily — clearing it per scene would orphan the texture created by
each earlier scene. Factor-only and shadow-only PBR materials therefore recreate
the fallback lazily on the replacement device. The environment and shadows are
restored before PBR groups rebuild so their captured shader builders see the
correct light and shadow state.

### SpriteRenderer

Sprite recovery enumerates only registered `sprite-renderer` contexts. Before
renderer state is rebuilt, it deduplicates and rebuilds every texture used by
the renderer:

- each layer's atlas `Texture2D`;
- custom-fragment extra `Texture2D`s;
- the optional offscreen render target.

The renderer then recreates its shared index buffer and every existing
per-layer instance buffer, layer UBO, custom-shader FX UBO, bind group,
pipeline reference, and render bundle. CPU instance arrays, layer membership
and ordering, visibility, transforms, dirty/version state, animation hooks,
clear settings, and target selection remain intact. Custom-shader FX elapsed
time restarts at zero because preserving that closure-only accumulator would
add recovery state to the normal custom-shader bundle. Device-keyed
shader/pipeline caches naturally select new-device entries.

URL, solid, bitmap, dynamic, raw-pixel, and empty render-target textures carry
pure recovery data only when Scene or Sprite recovery capture is enabled.
Raw-pixel updates and runtime atlas appends update the retained CPU copy.
Applications must enable recovery before creating/loading recoverable sprite
textures. Disabling the last capture-using handle stops retaining sources for
new resources; existing source records remain on their owning textures.

### Captured textures

Reachability is not sufficient to find them. A capture-stamped texture that no
registered context references at loss time — a sprite atlas page populated in
one render mode and idle in another — is invisible to the per-kind walks, and
would survive recovery still holding the lost device's `GPUTexture`. The capture
stamp therefore also tracks every texture it stamps, weakly, on the owning
recovery state, and the coordinator rebuilds that set once per loss after
surfaces are reconfigured and before any kind handler runs, so handlers bind
textures that are already current. The per-kind walks remain, for textures that
were never captured. Rebuilding is deduplicated on the recovery source and keyed
by device, so a source is uploaded once per loss however many wrappers or walks
reach it, a `url` source is fetched once, and a later loss rebuilds again. The
weak set is compacted when it doubles, never below a floor.

Wrappers derived from another wrapper are tracked in that same set. Both
`cloneTexture2D` and the glTF sampler path spread a base wrapper, so the result
inherits `_recoverySource` without passing through the stamp while owning its
own `texture` field. Deriving a wrapper notifies the capture module, which finds
the recovery state that captured the base's source — held weakly, so an
application texture outliving its engine cannot pin that engine's registrations
— and tracks the derived wrapper too. Tracking each one in its own right, rather
than reaching them by way of their base, is what recovers a clone whose base has
already been collected. The first wrapper reached rebuilds and the rest adopt
its texture, view, and size; a wrapper carrying its own captured sampler
descriptor gets that sampler rebuilt instead of the base's, so the glTF sampler
wrapper keeps its own wrap and filter settings.

Call sites reach that tracking two ways, for bundle-size reasons rather than
behavioural ones. Sites holding an engine use the `engine._dlr` capture seam
directly, which costs a property access and adds no module dependency. The glTF
sampler path is one of these: giving `gltf-sampler-desc` a runtime import of
`texture-2d` pulls that module into bundles that otherwise load it lazily or not
at all, which measured far larger than the feature itself. `cloneTexture2D` has
no engine — it is public API and glTF reaches it through
`GltfFeature.wrapTexture` — so it calls a module-level hook that the capture
installs and that stays null, and tree-shaken, in scenes that never enable
recovery. Both paths call the same tracking function.

Ownership and release are two separate questions, and recovery asks them
separately because the answers differ per kind.

Ownership is carried onto the replacement rather than re-established from the
kind. A rebuilt `GPUTexture` starts unowned, so recovery reads how many owners
the outgoing texture had and tops the replacement up to that number. Without it
the first consumer to bind and then unbind a rebuilt texture destroys it while
the application still holds the wrapper.

The top-up is deferred until every per-context handler has run, and that is what
makes the count correct rather than inflated. Recovery re-establishes part of the
pre-loss ownership itself: `rebuildSceneGpu` discards a mesh's queued texture
releases and re-acquires as it rebuilds the bind groups, and the dynamic-texture
rebuild re-takes its own reference. Adding the full pre-loss count on top of
those would double-count exactly them, leaving the texture permanently
over-owned — final disposal never reaches zero, so it is never destroyed, and the
released check below never fires for it on a later loss. Deferring needs no
tracking of which reference came from where: whatever is still missing once the
handlers have run is by definition ownership recovery did not restore by itself.
It is also a count rather than a single re-acquire, because a derived family can
hold several references to one texture — `cloneTexture2D` leaves that pairing to
the caller — and restoring only the creator's would bring the replacement back
short, so the next release would destroy a texture a sibling still points at.
Kinds whose creator never acquired, `createSolidTexture2D` and the glTF
`uploadTex` path, have no ownership to carry and get none. Wrappers that adopt
take none either, exactly as `cloneTexture2D` takes none at creation: they share
the references held for the texture they now point at.

Draining the meshes' queued releases before snapshotting would look like the same
fix and is not: for a solid or glTF-uploaded texture bound by a single renderable
the only reference is that renderable's, so draining takes the count to zero,
`releaseTexture` destroys the texture and leaves the zero entry below, and the
rebuild is then skipped for a texture the re-recorded bind group is about to use.

The queue of deferred ownership hangs off the engine's recovery state rather than
the module, because a lost GPU process loses every device on the page at once and
each engine then recovers on its own timeline. A shared queue would let whichever
engine reached its handlers first drain every engine's entries, restoring the
others to their full pre-loss count while their handlers had yet to re-acquire —
reintroducing the double-count above across engines instead of within one. Per
engine is also per run, but only because the coordinator makes it so: recovery
installs the replacement device on the engine long before its handlers finish
while `_armedDevice` still names the lost one, so a registration enabled in that
window used to arm the replacement, and losing it started a second run on the
same engine that shared this queue, the engine's device and its surface list.
`_recovering` now holds `arm` off for the duration of a run. Nothing is dropped
by waiting: the run re-arms once it resolves, and `GPUDevice.lost` is a promise,
so a device lost during the window resolves for that later subscriber too and is
recovered immediately afterwards. A failed run clears the flag without re-arming,
because the engine may still be on the lost device and arming it would spin
recovery forever. The queue is reached through the engine rather than
threaded as a parameter because the handlers' own walks call `rebuildTexture2D`
too, and a parameter those call sites did not pass would silently drop the
ownership of anything they rebuilt first.

Whether a texture has been _released_ is asked of every kind, because every kind
can reach that state — `releaseTexture` is public API, and its first call
destroys a texture whose creator took no reference of its own. Rebuilding a
destroyed texture hands a live one back to a wrapper the application has
finished with, and for a texture that had owners, takes references nothing will
ever release. Recovery therefore skips it.

That question is answered by the ref-count map, which distinguishes three
states: no entry means nothing ever took ownership, a positive count means the
texture is owned, and a zero entry means every owner released it and
`releaseTexture` destroyed it. `releaseTexture` leaves the zero behind rather
than deleting it, which is what makes "destroyed" distinguishable from "never
owned" — the key is weak either way, so the entry retains nothing. Reading three
states rather than two is what lets the check cover solid and glTF-uploaded
textures: treating their ownerless steady state as released would skip every one
of them and leave a whole glTF scene on the lost device.

The map is keyed on the `GPUTexture`, not the wrapper, so a derived family
shares one entry and reads as released from whichever wrapper recovery visits
first — whichever one performed the final release, no sibling rebuilds a
destroyed texture. The state is read on the recovery path rather than recorded
onto the wrapper by `releaseTexture`, which would put the bookkeeping in every
scene whether or not it ever recovers.

### TextRenderer

Text recovery enumerates only registered `text-renderer` contexts. It recreates
every existing layer UBO and instance buffer, invalidates bind groups,
pipelines, upload markers, and render bundles, and uploads the retained
`TextData` instance bytes. Every referenced Slug curve/band atlas is recreated
from `GlyphStorage`'s existing CPU arrays. Device-keyed text pipeline caches
produce the replacement pipeline and shared quad buffer. Layer membership,
ordering, placement, opacity, coverage gamma, visibility, `TextData` slot
layout, and glyph storage remain unchanged. Text recovery needs no additional
capture because those CPU arrays are already the authoritative text state.

Resources that belong to callers remain caller-owned after recovery:
SpriteRenderer does not dispose atlases, custom textures, or render targets;
TextRenderer does not dispose `TextData` or `GlyphStorage`.

## Lazy Rebuild Boundaries

The coordinator keeps only registration, required-feature capture, and the
`device.lost` listener in the steady-state bundle. A loss dynamically imports
`engine/device-lost-recovery-run`, which acquires and configures the replacement
device, dispatches recovery handlers, and restarts rendering. Public enabler
modules contain only callback wiring, kind registration, and small capture
coordination. Their `_recover` callbacks use further dynamic imports:

- Scene imports `engine/recovery-rebuild`;
- Sprite imports `sprite/sprite-recovery`, which may import texture recovery;
- Text imports `text/text-recovery`.

The package root may export all three enablers without statically retaining
SpriteRenderer, TextRenderer, their shaders, pipelines, texture rebuilders, or
glyph-atlas upload code in unrelated bundles. All modules have zero
module-level side effects; mutable caches remain null until an explicit call.

## State Machine / Lifecycle

1. Enable each context kind the application wants to recover.
2. For Scene/Sprite, enable before creating resources that require retained
CPU/source data.
3. Register contexts and render normally.
4. On non-deliberate loss (or the internal testing marker), callbacks fire and
the single coordinator performs replacement and per-kind rebuild.
5. Rendering resumes with the same public renderer/data objects.
6. Disable handles independently. Existing renderers continue rendering but
their kind is no longer recoverable after its final handle is disabled.

## Test Specification

- Coordinator unit tests cover mixed Scene/Sprite/Text registration, repeated
registrations, safe idempotent disable, and shared capture lifetime.
- Fail-fast unit tests cover a registered context whose kind has no enabled
handler: the error names the offending kinds, deduplicated and stably ordered,
and is thrown before any resource is disposed or a replacement device is
requested.
- Captured-texture unit tests cover weak tracking, rebuilding a texture no
registered context references, restoring bytes appended after creation into
the wrapper the application still holds, one rebuild per source per device,
derived wrappers (including one whose base was collected, and one carrying its
own sampler), a single shared rebuild leaving every wrapper on the same
texture/view/sampler, skipping a released texture across every recoverable
kind — both a single wrapper and a family whose clone performed the final
release — still rebuilding an ownerless texture nothing has released, each
creator-owned kind surviving one consumer acquire/release cycle, a derived
family's second reference surviving the rebuild, the dynamic rebuild's own
reference being counted rather than doubled, a handler that re-acquires as
it rebuilds its bind groups leaving a count final disposal can still bring to
zero, and two engines recovering concurrently — one parked inside its handlers
while the other completes — settling only their own textures.
- A coordinator-driven test loses a device, parks the run inside its handlers,
then enables a further recovery kind and loses the replacement. It asserts no
second run starts on that engine while the first is in flight, and that the
deferred loss is nonetheless recovered once the first run settles.
- Scene recovery unit tests replace the device under an ESM shadow generator
and assert that its textures, sampler, UBOs, hidden blur resources, and nested
render task are recreated while the generator identity remains stable and the
PBR fallback is cleared before material groups rebuild.
- A real-loss browser scene covers environment-lit PBR, a directional ESM
caster, and a shadow-only receiver. It asserts replacement-device
environment/fallback/shadow resources, preserved environment identity, no
uncaptured WebGPU errors, credible non-flat output, and at least 50 rendered
frames after recovery.
- Sprite unit tests replace a fake device and assert new index, instance,
uniform, FX, pipeline/bind-group/bundle state, recovered atlas/custom/target
textures, preserved CPU/layer state, and exact-kind enumeration.
- Text unit tests replace a fake device and assert new layer buffers and Slug
atlas textures, invalidated/rebuilt bindings and bundles, preserved
`TextData`/layer state, and exact-kind enumeration.
- Existing Sprite/Text renderer unit suites remain green.
- A focused browser recovery scene is preferred when it can exercise an
existing deterministic Sprite/Text scene without changing golden images or
MAD/bundle ceilings. Full parity and bundle-manifest regeneration remain a
PR-preparation guardrail when explicitly requested.
